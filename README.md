# Greenwich Blockchain Store - Frontend

This is a frontend for the Greenwich Blockchain Association merch store which uses a smart contract from https://github.com/kryptopaul/greenwich-blockchain-store-contract.

Although it works just like a normal store, it adds transparency in regards to sold items and the donated amount from all sales. The data is fetched from the contract using Ethers.js. The page itself has been built with React and Mantine UI library.
